# too difficult for me, hard to interpret!

distance-based methods (Â Mahalanobis )

projection pursuit 



kurtosis weights 

This enables us to assign weights to each component according to how likely we

think it is to reveal the outliers.





## [mvoutlier](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvoutlier/index.html): Multivariate Outlier Detection Based on Robust Methods

```R
pcout(x, makeplot = FALSE, explvar = 0.99, crit.M1 = 1/3, crit.c1 = 2.5,
crit.M2 = 1/4, crit.c2 = 0.99, cs = 0.25, outbound = 0.25, ...)
```

crit.M1 a numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the quantile to be used as lower boundary for location outlier detection (default to 1/3) 

crit.c1 a positive numeric value used for determining the upper boundary for location outlier detection (default to 2.5) 

crit.M2 a numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the quantile to be used as lower boundary for scatter outlier detection (default to 1/4) 

crit.c2 a numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the quantile to be used as upper boundary for scatter outlier detection (default to 0.99)

cs a numeric value indicating the scaling constant for combined location and scatter weights (default to 0.25)

```R
# geochemical data from northern Europe
data(bsstop)
x=bsstop[,5:14]
# identify multivariate outliers
x.out=pcout(x,makeplot=T)
# visualize multivariate outliers in the map
op <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
data(bss.background)
pbb(asp=1)
points(bsstop$XCOO,bsstop$YCOO,pch=16,col=x.out$wfinal01+2)
title("Outlier detection based on pcout")
legend("topleft",legend=c("potential outliers","regular observations"),pch=16,col=c(2,3))
# compare with outlier detection based on MCD:
x.mcd <- robustbase::covMcd(x)
pbb(asp=1)
points(bsstop$XCOO,bsstop$YCOO,pch=16,col=x.mcd$mcd.wt+2)
title("Outlier detection based on MCD")
legend("topleft",legend=c("potential outliers","regular observations"),pch=16,col=c(2,3))
par(op)
```

Result 

**wfinal01** 0/1 vector with final weights for each observation; weight 0 indicates potential multivariate outliers. 

**wfinal** numeric vector with final weights for each observation; small values indicate potential multivariate outliers.

**wloc** numeric vector with weights for each observation; small values indicate potential location outliers. 

**wscat** numeric vector with weights for each observation; small values indicate potential scatter outliers. 

**x.dist1** numeric vector with distances for location outlier detection. 

**x.dist2** numeric vector with distances for scatter outlier detection. 

**M1** upper boundary for assigning weight 1 in location outlier detection. 

**const1** lower boundary for assigning weight 0 in location outlier detection. 

**M2** upper boundary for assigning weight 1 in scatter outlier detection. 

**const2** lower boundary for assigning weight 0 in scatter outlier detection.
